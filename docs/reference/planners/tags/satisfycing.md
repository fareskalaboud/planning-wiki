# Satisfycing Planners

Page Contributors: {% git_author %}

The planners listed below are planners that belong to subset of satisfycing planners. Planners are satisfycing if they find any plan to problem presented, regardless of quality.

In Satisfycing planning resource management, particularly time, is the determining factor. Satisfycing planners should attempt to find any solution in as short a time as possible.

This page makes no distinction between classically satisfycing planners and temporal numeric satisfycing planners.
